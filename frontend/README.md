## API Integration

The frontend connects to the FastAPI backend at `http://localhost:8000` through Vite's proxy configuration.

### Key Endpoints Used

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/users/signup` - Register new user
- `POST /api/users/login` - Login with JWT tokens
- `POST /api/users/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user

**Activities:**
- `GET /api/activities` - List activities
- `POST /api/activities` - Create activity (with GPS routes)
- `GET /api/activities/:id` - Get activity details
- `DELETE /api/activities/:id` - Delete activity

**Recommendations:**
- `POST /api/recommend` - Get AI-powered recommendations
- `GET /api/recommend/strategies` - List available strategies

**Location & Social:**
- `POST /api/location/update` - Update user location
- `GET /api/location/mutual-followers` - Get nearby mutual followers  
- `GET /api/location/proximity` - Check proximity alerts
- `POST /api/location/toggle` - Toggle location sharing

**Export:**
- `GET /api/export/activity/:id/gpx` - Export as GPX
- `GET /api/export/activity/:id/tcx` - Export as TCX
- `GET /api/export/activity/:id/json` - Export as JSON

## Design

The UI follows Strava's design language with:
- Primary color: `#FC4C02` (Strava Orange)
- Clean, card-based layout
- Sport-specific icons and colors
- Responsive grid system

## Development Tips

1. **Hot Reload**: Changes automatically reflect in the browser
2. **API Proxy**: All `/api/*` requests are proxied to the backend
3. **Tailwind**: Use utility classes for styling
4. **Icons**: Import from `lucide-react`

## Environment Variables

### Mapbox GL API Key (Required for Enhanced Maps)

For the Record Activity page with professional GPS tracking, you'll need a Mapbox API key:

1. **Get a free Mapbox token**: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
2. **Create `.env` file** in the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoieW91cnVzZXJuYW1lIiwiYSI6ImN...your-token-here
   ```
3. **Restart the dev server** after adding the token

**Full setup guide**: See [MAPBOX_SETUP.md](./MAPBOX_SETUP.md)

**Note**: The app will work without a token (uses basic OpenStreetMap fallback), but you'll get better map features with Mapbox!

## GPS Activity Recording

### Features
The Record Activity page provides professional-grade GPS tracking:

**Permission Flow:**
- Clear modal explaining why location is needed
- Browser native permission prompt
- Graceful fallback to network positioning
- Visual feedback during permission request

**GPS Tracking:**
- **High Accuracy Mode** - Uses device GPS satellites
- **Kalman Filtering** - Smooths GPS noise for clean routes
- **Accuracy Filtering** - Only accepts quality GPS points
- **Movement Validation** - Filters impossible speeds/jumps
- **Real-time Metrics** - Distance, pace, speed, elevation
- **GPS Quality Indicator** - Shows signal strength 0-100%

**Route Visualization:**
- **Strava Orange Line** - Professional `#FC4C02` color
- **Real-time Drawing** - Route appears as you move
- **Shadow Effect** - Depth for better visibility
- **Auto-Follow** - Map smoothly pans to follow you
- **Start/Current Markers** - Green start, orange current position

### Demo Mode

Can't test outdoors? Use the built-in 5km Run Simulation:

```javascript
// Click "Try Demo: 5km Run Simulation" button
// Features:
- Generates realistic 5km route with natural turns
- Simulates GPS at 10 points/second
- Updates all metrics in real-time (distance, pace, elevation)
- Completes in ~50 seconds
- Perfect for testing and demonstrations
```

**Demo Controls:**
- Pause/Resume simulation
- Stop and save simulated activity
- View live stats and route drawing
- All features work exactly like real GPS

### GPS Implementation Details

**PrecisionLocationService.js:**
```javascript
- Kalman Filter for coordinate smoothing
- Haversine formula for distance calculations
- Movement validation (max speed checks)
- Accuracy history tracking
- GPS quality scoring (0-100%)
- Automatic network fallback
```

**Accuracy Thresholds:**
- Production: <50m for best quality
- Testing: Accepts up to 50km for indoor/network positioning
- Configurable per environment

## Nearby Friends Feature

### Location Sharing
Real-time location tracking for mutual followers:

**Privacy First:**
- Only mutual followers can see your location
- Easy on/off toggle
- Location updates every 30 seconds
- Stops when app closes

**Demo Data:**
Built-in sample users that persist even when location sharing is enabled:
- Sarah Johnson (250m away, Running - 3.2km)
- Mike Chen (680m away, Cycling - 12.5km)
- Emma Davis (1.2km away, Walking)
- Alex Martinez (320m away, Running - 5.1km)

Shows "Demo Data" badge when using samples.

**Features:**
- Interactive map with all nearby users
- Distance calculations in real-time
- Activity status for each user
- Proximity alerts (<500m)
- Direct messaging
- Profile viewing

## Design System

The UI follows Strava's design language with:

**Colors:**
- Primary: `#FC4C02` (Strava Orange)
- GPS Route: `#FC4C02` (Orange line)
- Success: `#10B981` (Green)
- Warning: `#F59E0B` (Amber)
- Error: `#EF4444` (Red)

**Components:**
- Clean, card-based layout
- Sport-specific icons and colors
- Responsive grid system
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional typography (Inter font)

## Troubleshooting

### GPS Issues

**Location Permission Denied:**
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Change Location to "Allow"
3. Refresh page or click "Try Again"

**GPS Stuck on "Acquiring Signal":**
1. Open browser console (F12) to see detailed logs
2. Check device GPS is enabled
3. Move to open area with sky view
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for satellites
5. Or use Demo Mode for testing

**Route Not Showing:**
- Check console for "Route rendered on map"
- Ensure Mapbox token is set (or fallback active)
- Verify route has at least 2 GPS points

### Map Issues

**Map Not Loading:**
1. Add Mapbox token to `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.eyJ...
   ```
2. App will fallback to OpenStreetMap if no token
3. Check console for errors

**Nearby Friends No Data:**
- Demo data should persist even with location sharing on
- Check "Demo Data" badge
- Console shows "keeping demo data" if API fails

## Testing

### Test GPS Recording
```bash
# 1. Indoor Testing (Demo Mode)
- Click "Try Demo: 5km Run Simulation"
- Watch route draw in real-time
- Verify exactly 5.00km distance
- Check all metrics update

# 2. Outdoor Testing (Real GPS)
- Go outdoors with clear sky
- Enable location when prompted  
- Wait for accuracy < 50m
- Start recording and walk/run
- Verify route draws behind you
```

### Test Nearby Friends
```bash
# With Location Sharing Off
- Should see 4 demo users
- "Demo Data" badge visible
- All features interactive

# With Location Sharing On
- Demo data persists
- Map shows your location
- Can still interact with demo users
```

## Performance

**Optimizations:**
- Lazy loading for routes
- Mapbox vector tiles for fast rendering
- GPS update throttling (1 point/second)
- Route simplification for storage
- Efficient state management

**Bundle Size:**
- Initial JS: ~250KB (gzipped)
- Mapbox GL: ~200KB (loaded on demand)
- Total initial load: <500KB

## Browser Support

**Full Support:**
- Chrome/Edge 90+ (Best GPS experience)
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+ (iOS 14+)

**GPS Features:**
- Desktop: WiFi/network positioning
- Mobile: Full GPS satellite support
- All: Geolocation API required

**Note:** GPS works best on mobile devices with actual GPS hardware!
